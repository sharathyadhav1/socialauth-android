## How does it Work? ##

Once SocialAuth Android is integrated into your application, following is the authentication process:

  1. User opens the app and chooses the provider to request the authentication by using SocialAuth-android library.
  1. User is redirected to Facebook, Twitter or other provider's login site by library where they enter their credentials.
  1. Upon successful login, provider asks for userâ€™s permission to share their basic data with your app.
  1. Once user accepts it,On successful authentication the library redirects user to app.
  1. Now user can call SocialAuth Android library to get information about user profile, gets contacts list or share status to friends.
